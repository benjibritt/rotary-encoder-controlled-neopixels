# rotary-encoder-controlled-neopixels
Use a rotary encoder to switch Neopixels between different patterns.
This is my prototype to control neopixels using a rotary encoder. The Arduino code still has some errors, the biggest of which is that while the neopixels are running a pattern, they won't switch to another until the first is over.
This is both by first repository, and my first arduino project, so I'm hoping there is somone out there who can take what I've done, and make some improvments on it.
